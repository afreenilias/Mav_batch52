In the deployment setup, change the image name.
To apply the deployment update, use the command 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'.
Kubernetes will begin the process of creating new pods, each with the modified image. It will gradually replace the old pods with these new instances.
All pods will run successfully with the new image.

apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-app spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app spec: containers: - name: my-app image: my-app:latest

The deployment setup is named "my-app" with just one copy running. Inside this setup, there's a container named "my-app," and it's using an image called "my-app:latest."

Now, suppose you want to update this image. if you want to switch to "my-app:1.2.3," you just edit that line to say "my-app:1.2.3." It's quick and straightforward.
